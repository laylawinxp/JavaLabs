Hi, my name is Tina. I am thirteen years old, and today I want to talk about my best friend Selena.
She is my classmate, and she is thirteen years old too. She plays volleyball at our school team.
We both have a busy life. Our fathers are both engineers, but they work at different companies.
On Mondays, Selena has violin class and I have piano class. On the weekends, we usually have a picnic. I am the
only child, I donâ€™t have a sister, but she is like a sister to me.
